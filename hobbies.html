                <h1>Hobbies</h1>
                <p>
                    Hobbies...I'm generally someone who enjoys most things I do, regardless of the activity. But of course, some things are more special than others.Cooking especially for my loved ones, playing volleyball, playing the violin, watching footbal games, listening to music, everything by the sea, watching the sunset/sunrise and more...
                </p>

                <h3>Cooking</h3>
                <p>
                    Cooking is like therapy for me. Cooking with music relaxes me a lot. I especially love watching my loved ones eat the food I make and evaluating their reactions to my food.
                </p>

                <h3>Playing Volleyball</h3>
                <p>
                    I have been playing volleyball since school. I also played on the school team for 2 years in high school. I have loved all kinds of sports, but playing volleyball is a passion for me.
                </p>

                <h3>Watching Football Games</h3>
                <p>
                    If you ask what the best evening activity is, I would say watching a match with snacks. I am interested not only in matches but also in the players, teams and their playing styles. Watching the matches of teams I support from different countries is also very enjoyable for me.
                </p>

                <h3>Playing Violin</h3>
                <p>
                    I saw it in TV series and movies and took a course for about 4 years when I was a kid. Music is something that relaxes and gives peace. It's not at the center of my life right now because of my busy schedule and being more active in high school volleyball, but I try to play it from time to time and not lose touch with it.
                </p>

                <h3>Listening to Music</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, it may be the most common hobby for all of us. I am that person who can't do anything without music. Because of that music is a big part of my life, and I listen to a wide variety of genres depending on my mood. It helps me focus, relax, and even find inspiration.
