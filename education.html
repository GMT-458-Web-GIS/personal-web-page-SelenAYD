                            I studied at Vahide Aktuğ Secondary School in Bursa. My favorite subject in secondary school was mathematics. I loved my teachers, my friends and my school.

                            I studied at Çamlıca Anatolian High School, which is also in Bursa. In high school, I chose the numerical department because I wanted to be an engineer. I was on the school's volleyball team when I was in high school. Socially, I was more of a quiet person.

                            I came to Ankara after being accepted to Hacettepe University Geomatics Engineering Department. I have been living in Ankara for 3 years. I am in the 4th year of my department. I am studying in my department with great pleasure. The most different and exciting years of my life were spent in Ankara. I am very happy to be here.

                            When I was in my third year of university, I was accepted the Erasmus program and went to Warsaw, the capital of Poland. I studied at the Warsaw University of Technology for 5 months. It was the best thing in my life.
